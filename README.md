# Production Controller makroShield
The Production Controller makroShield (PCM) is a modular controller designed to operate 24 V devices with the help of connected and remote sensors.

The PCM has a mikroBUS socket that works with Espoir, our Power over Ethernet devboard, to provide remote control, as well as advanced functionalities through node-red and Home Assistant. Simpler control can be achieved by directly programming Espoir.

Originally designed to operate greenhouses and irrigation valves, it can be adapted to many different kinds of small productions and climate control due to its modular nature.

2 drivers are available with the PCM: a 2-ways driver for bidirectional motors, and a 1-way, AC/DC controller for other devices, like valves, fans, and unidirectional motors. Up to 15 drivers can be connected simultaneously, and scheduled to use up to 350 Watts of power at a time.

Being modular makes the PCM easy to repair and upgrade, and helps reduce cost for smaller operations.
